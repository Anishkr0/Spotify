# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is a Spotify Song Downloader built using React, Tailwind CSS, and RapidAPI. It allows users to search for their favorite songs from Spotify and download them easily through a clean and responsive interface. The app integrates RapidAPI to fetch song data and provide download links seamlessly. React ensures smooth functionality and efficient state management, while Tailwind CSS is used to create a modern, visually appealing design. By combining powerful API integration with a user-friendly interface, this project delivers a simple and effective way to search from Spotify  and download songs in just few seconds .
